*****************************************************************************
I. Motivation

  - have a place to monitor:
        > temperature of the channels of the dilution refrigerator (DR)
        > flow rate of the cooling water of the He compressor outside building
        > temperature of the He compressor
        > temperature and humidity of the lab room

  - can monitor instruments from the office room while the DR is operating,
    without having to go to the lab room

*****************************************************************************
II. Program Descriptions

  - test_website.html
        ->  draft website for placement of things on website

*****************************************************************************
III. Comments

  - will most likely not be on a domain or server, as that is a bit
    complicated for current purposes
